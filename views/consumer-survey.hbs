                        <p>Consumers are demanding so much more from their cosmetics products.</p>

                        On the strength of shifting consumer preferences, such as those for sustainability,
                        transparency, and personalization, the cosmetics industry is being forced to adapt. Tapping into
                        social media trends is the key to identifying the investment pockets. Brands must understand
                        consumers&#39; needs and reactions to these developments.</p>

                    <p>A substantial change is taking place in the beauty sector. Consumers are increasingly looking for
                        safer substitutes, with the use of natural components increasing and the use of chemical
                        additions declining. As a result, in the upcoming year, we anticipate the emergence of several
                        new trends.</p>

                    <p>Consumers are moving away from conventional additives like parabens and phthalates as they become
                        more aware of the concerns connected with certain chemicals. Cancer and reproductive issues are
                        frequently associated to these substances, respectively. As a result, customers are increasingly
                        looking for secure substitutes for these dangerous compounds. The top 10 components we believe
                        will become more popular in 2023 and onwards are&hellip;.</p>
